        <h2> WHAT ARE WE ABOUT? </h2>
        <p> Our group delves into the rich symbolism of the serpent across various mythologies and religious traditions, exploring how this powerful symbol has been interpreted throughout history. We also offer comparative studies of different religions, all grounded in a Bible-based perspective. Our approach is despite being Bible-based, open-minded and inviting, welcoming people of all backgrounds and beliefs. We believe in providing non-biased, well-researched resources and teachings that are freely available to everyone. Through the Church, we offer a safe space for learning and discussion, where curiosity is encouraged, and diverse perspectives are valued. Whether you're looking to deepen your understanding of your own faith or explore new ideas, our group provides a welcoming community to do so. </p>
