        <h2> WHAT ARE WE ABOUT? </h2>
        <p> Our group delves into the rich symbolism of the serpent across various mythologies and religious traditions, exploring how this powerful symbol has been interpreted throughout history. We also offer comparative studies of different religions, all grounded in a Bible-based perspective. Despite our foundation in the Bible, we are open-minded and inviting, welcoming people of all backgrounds and beliefs. Our goal is to provide non-biased, well-researched resources and teachings that are freely accessible to everyone. </p>
        <p> Through our Church, we offer a safe space for learning and discussion, where curiosity is encouraged, and diverse perspectives are valued. Whether you're looking to deepen your understanding of your own faith or explore new ideas, our group provides a welcoming community for you to do so. </p>
        <p> We also host live game nights that welcome people of all ages, along with free groups offering marriage counseling and guidance. Our aim is to ensure that everyone finds the support and resources they need within our community. </p>
